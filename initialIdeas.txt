Hey guys, figured I would put some initial ideas here
-----------------------------------------------------

* Pharmaceutical drug database - see what drugs are in what products and display common symptoms and other doctor-focused stats (Drew's idea)
* Pokedex (Nate's idea)
* Legal cases (Eric's idea)

I'd rather not do a lot of data pruning-- but a cool project might be worth it.
